        <h2>First Concept</h2>
        <p>im going to start at the absulte begenning, the fondementals of all programing.Operators! Lets go over a list of Javascript operators. Arithmetic operators, assignment Operator, Comparison Operators, String Operators, Logical Operators, Bitwise Operators, Ternary Operators and Type Operators.</p>
        <p>the assignment Operator is simply the equal sign (=) this is the asignment Operatorin pretty much every language as far as i know. lets say we want to asign a value to a variable you could use the var keyword, then you could name it and then asign a value, like this (var number = 12). its hoestly to simple to go into to much detail about.</p>
        <p>now lets look at arithmetic operators, these are also really simple because these are just the literally just arithmetic operators, + addition - subtraction * multiplication / division. and they do exactly that.</p>
